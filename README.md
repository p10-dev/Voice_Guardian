Development of a Mobile Tracker with Voice Recognition leveraging AI and GSM Technology for Enhanced Personal Security


Traditional mobile tracking systems rely solely on GPS technology, which can be ineffective in indoor environments or areas with poor satellite coverage. Additionally, the ability to trigger alerts using voice commands is limited. This research project seeks to develop a comprehensive mobile tracker that combines AI-driven voice recognition with GSM technology to provide real-time and accurate tracking, especially in challenging environments where false positives can occur.
